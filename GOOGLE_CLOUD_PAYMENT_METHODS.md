Some PayPal services offer prepaid cards:

⚠️ **Unreliable** - May not work

---

### Option 4: Use Friend/Family Card

If someone you trust has a card:

1. They add card to your Google Cloud account

4. Card is just for billing verification

**Important:**

If you have a business:

- Use business account card
- Set up proper business billing
